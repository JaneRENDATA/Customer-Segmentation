# Customer-Segmentation

This repository contains my code for Project 4: Customer Segments, part of the Machine Learning Masterclass offered by EliteDataScience.

The goal of this project is to develop customer segmentations using purchase/transaction data.

The repository contains the following Python code:

* Module 1 - Data Wrangling.ipynb
* Module 2 - Dimensionality Reduction.ipynb
* Module 3 - Principal Component Analysis.ipynb
* Module 5 - Cluster.ipynb

The raw data set used for the modules is in project_files/int_online_tx.csv. The data dictionary is called Project-4-Data-Dictionary.pdf

The remaining objects in this repository are either intermediate copies of data tables created in the Modules or back-up copies of data.

To get started with this repo, review the data dictionary and begin with Module 1. For a more guided introduction through the project, I highly recommend checking out EliteDataScience's Machine Learning Masterclass.
